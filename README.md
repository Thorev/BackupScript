## üìå Purpose
The script provides automated file backup functionality, copying files from specified source folders to destination locations with optional archiving capabilities. The entire process is controlled via a configuration (.ini) file.

---

## üöÄ How to Use
Double-click the `run_backup.bat` file to execute the backup process

The script will automatically:

Read configuration from the .ini file

Perform all enabled backup tasks

Generate logs of the operation

Note: Do not run the PowerShell script directly - it must be launched via the batch file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (INI File Setup)
Main Settings Section

`[Settings]`

`LogPath = log.log`  # Path to the log file (can be renamed or relocated)


Backup Task Sections
For each backup task, create a section with the following structure:

`[source1]`  # Task identifier (increment number for additional tasks)

`Enabled = true`             # true to enable, false to disable this task

`Source = E:\BACKUP_source`  # Source directory to back up

`Destination = F:\BACKUP_destination`  # Target backup location

`Archive = true`             # Enable ZIP archiving (true/false)

---
[source2]

Enabled = false

Source = C:\ImportantFiles

Destination = D:\Backups\Important

Archive = false

[source3]

Enabled = true

Source = \\NAS\Shared

Destination = G:\NAS_Backups

Archive = true

---

Example for additional tasks:

`[source2]`

`Enabled = false`

`Source = C:\ImportantFiles`

`Destination = D:\Backups\Important`

`Archive = false`


`[source3]`

`Enabled = true`

`Source = \\NAS\Shared`

`Destination = G:\NAS_Backups`

`Archive = true`

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è Requirements
PowerShell 7.5 or higher

Must be executed via run_backup.bat (direct execution may default to PowerShell 5.x and fail)
